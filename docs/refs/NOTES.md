# Reference management notes

- SysML v2 textual and KerML PDFs inform the internal IR field set (metaclasses, containment, relationships) to keep alignment with the standard semantics.
- SysML API & Services references guide the REST endpoints and workspace payload shapes so they can evolve toward interoperability.
- Diagram rendering guidance comes from Sprotty and ELK for eventual interactive canvas behaviors.
- For the initial MVP, a **Block Definition Diagram (BDD)** is chosen as the first supported diagram type because it requires fewer interaction primitives than an IBD (ports/connectors) while still exercising containment, relationships, and labeling.
